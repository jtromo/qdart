## Contributing to qdart

### Steps

1. Create a branch and contribute your changes.
2. Submit a pull request (details below).
3. Request to cut a release (using semantic versioning).

#### Creating a Pull Request

- When making a pull request, use the provided pull request template.
- Commit messages should begin with a prefix of the branch name.
- The work in the pull request should align with the title.  
- Any updates to the pull request that would alter the description require the description to be updated and a comment left for reviewers to make them aware.
- Acceptance Criteria is just as important as a Description or Solution.  It should be on every pull request and in a behavior driven development format when reasonable.
- Adding test instructions and noting possible areas of regression encourages a smooth review process.
